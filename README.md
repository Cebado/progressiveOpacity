progressiveOpacity
=================

Very simple and easy to use jQuery function that makes elements to appear progressively while scrolling.

The topLimit variable indicates the position where you want to start the degradation.

The degradation variable indicates how fast you want it to be. "degradation" must be bigger than "topLimit".
